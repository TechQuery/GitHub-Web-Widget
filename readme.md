# GitHub jQuery Repo Widget
Drop this script on your page and it will build you a beautiful widget that displays the status of your GitHub repo.

## What does it look like?
![Widget Image](/demo/screenshotRelease.png?raw=true "jQuery Repo Widget Screenshot")

## How do I use it?
Everywhere you want a widget to be placed, add the following markup:

```<div class="github-widget" data-repo="hermajan/GitHub-jQuery-Repo-Widget"></div>```

Then include the javascript file somewhere after you've include jQuery:

```<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.githubRepoWidgetRelease.min.js"></script>```

That's it! All of the styling is included and image assets are pulled from GitHub.
